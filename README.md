# FreeMCBootConf
My personal FreeMCBoot Config for PS2 and the latest version of FreeMCBoot

All  entries (besides fastlaunches) refer to files on the root of a mass storage first and second on "mc?" which makes FMCB check both memory cards.
"Fastboot" and Debug are set to 0

The config contains the following entries:

- OPL
- PSX Launcher
- PS2 PSX Emulator
- Launch fast from USB (Launches "Fast.ELF" or "Fast.elf" from USB root)
- Simple Media System (SMS)
- uLaunchELF
- HD Loader
- ESR
- Fastboot Disk
- Reload Configuration (Simply restarts the PS2 Menu)
- Free MCBoot Configurator
